## Dynamic-Walk-Animations-for-Roblox [0.2.1]
Half broken dynamic walk animation and footing script for R6 characters in Roblox. 

Feedback is appreciated.

### To-do
    * Pick between the current and previous way of finding the footing placement (Current one is more complex, thus harder to polish).
    * Update the leg pointer.
    * Add r15 support.
    * Optimize and remove redundant value.
    * Add more comments.
